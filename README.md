# My Local Market 

## What will my market do?

Local Market is a shopping application where you can buy and sell your
items to your neighbors. You can buy a small portion of spices or vegetables
from your residence mates whenever you need them. In addition, if you have an unused item such as a bottle of milk or detergent,
you can post it on the Local Market, earn money and connect with new people. If you are a green
person, using this app will also help the environment
as well!

## Why this project?

Using the Local Market will help you save your money as well as environment! You do not
need to pay any tax or delivery fee. You are also able to buy stuff in any amount
you want. It can be convenient when it comes to the time-management as well.
No bus driving to the Save-on-foods and no need to stay in line to pay. Just
hop on the elevator and knock on your neighbor's door!
