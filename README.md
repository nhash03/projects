# My Local Market 

## What will my market do?

If you've ever lived at a residence, you know that your neighbors
are your guardian angels. Cooking pasta and forgetting that your salt ends?
Just ask your neighbors' community.

But if you are an introverted person like me who cannot ask others
to lend you ingredients, or your neighbor doesn't have that specific item,
then the local market will help you.

You can easily find your residence and connect with a group of your neighbors. You can
post what you need and buy it from a neighbor, or what you find useless and lend it to a neighbor in this
market and sell it. You should just get on the elevator and knock on someone's door;
hence you won't pay any tax or delivery fee.

## Why this project?

I'm an introverted girl who lives on-campus. I usually cook at
home and one of my daily issues is the lack of ingredients.
Not only at cooking, but when it comes to cleaning or doing your laundry, you may
run out of essential items. You cannot always ask your roommate or people
around you to lend you stuff. With this local market, you can buy things
you are looking for (even in tiny amounts) and connect with new people in
your area.

In addition, another benefit of this project is that it will prevent wasting and helps sustainability. Consider the following situation:

Your milk will expire in a day and you're pretty sure that you won't use it. In a normal case,
you are going to throw it away but with the Local market, you can share it with your neighbors and ask if anyone needs it. You will earn money while helping others get what they want.
